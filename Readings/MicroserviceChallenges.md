# Microservice challenges 

The below challenges are something which need to be considered during microservice development. Hence they are brought in as is. Link to the original post is given below.  

## Our Assumptions 

- Faster deployments
- Faster releases
- Fewer bugs
- Independent teams
- Sounds cool on your resume

## Challenges 

- Managing 100+ repositories
- Distributed transactions issues
- Strong consistency challenges
- Saga & compensation complexity
- Debugging across many services
- Event-driven architecture complexities
- Service communication overhead
- Handling failures
- Monitoring multiple services
- Logging across different systems
- Deployment coordination complexities
- Version compatibility headaches
- Increased network latency
- Data synchronization problems
- Configuration management complexities
- Difficult troubleshooting
- Security between services
- Complex local development setup
- Load balancing challenges
- Harder team alignment

Microservices are powerful â€” but only if used in the right place. 

Do every project need microservices? Probably most of the projects don't need them.

The complexity in microservices doesn't disappear; it just scales to another dimension.

Find below the link to the original post, though it did not come from any official org, the points mentioned above makes a lot of sense.
