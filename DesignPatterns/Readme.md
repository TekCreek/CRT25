# Design Patterns 

## Creational patterns 

Handle how objects are created.

### Some Examples 

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

Abstract Factory: Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations.

## Structural patterns 

Deal with how classes and objects are composed and related.

### Some Examples 

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

Decorator: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting other objects.

Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

Proxy: Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object

## Behavioral patterns 

Focus on interaction and responsibility between objects within a system.

### Some Examples 

Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, e.g. filter chain.

Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing.

Iterator: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its structure.

Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring specific steps to subclasses.
